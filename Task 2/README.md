- **7 Data Sets:** Each dataset contains different columns and values.
- **Data Model:** This shows the relationships between all datasets and any links for merging tables.

## Steps to Follow

### 1. Requirements Gathering

- Review the 7 datasets and the data model provided by the client.
- Use the data model to identify which datasets are required to answer the business question: "What are the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity?"
- Complete the multi-choice quiz to confirm your selected datasets.

### 2. Data Cleaning

- Inspect the selected datasets for any inconsistencies, missing values, or errors.
- Clean the data to ensure it is accurate and consistent.
- Document any cleaning steps taken for future reference.

### 3. Data Modeling

- Use the data model to understand the relationships between the selected datasets.
- Merge the datasets based on the relationships identified in the data model.
- Ensure that the merged data is structured correctly for analysis.

### 4. Data Analysis

- Analyze the cleaned and merged data to identify the top 5 content categories with the largest aggregate popularity.
- Use appropriate data analysis techniques and tools to generate insights.
- Visualize the results to communicate your findings effectively.


## Tools and Technologies

- **SQL:** For extracting and merging datasets.
- **Python/R:** For data cleaning and analysis.
- **Data Visualization Tools:** For visualizing the results (e.g., Tableau, Power BI).

## Deliverables

- **Cleaned Data Sets:** Documented and cleaned datasets ready for analysis.
