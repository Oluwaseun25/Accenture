# Social Buzz Engagement Overview

## Client Information
- **Name:** Social Buzz
- **Industry:** Social Media & Content Creation
- **Year Established:** 2010
- **Location of HQ:** San Francisco, CA
- **Number of Employees:** 250

## Background
Social Buzz was founded in 2010 by two former engineers from a large social media conglomerate. The founders, one from London and the other from San Francisco, started Social Buzz to create a new platform where content takes center stage. By keeping all users anonymous and emphasizing user reactions to content, Social Buzz ensures that trending content is at the forefront of user feeds. With over 100 ways for users to react to content, Social Buzz has grown to over 500 million active users each month in the past five years.

## Challenges and Objectives
Due to rapid growth and the digital nature of their core product, Social Buzz generates, collects, and analyzes an enormous amount of unstructured data daily. With 100,000+ pieces of content posted each day, they require sophisticated technology to manage and maintain this data. Although they have not previously relied on third-party firms, they are now seeking external expertise for the following reasons:

1. **IPO Preparation:** Guidance to ensure a smooth IPO process by the end of next year.
2. **Scaling Challenges:** Assistance in managing their current scale without hiring more staff.
3. **Big Data Best Practices:** Learning best practices from large corporations to manage their vast data effectively.
